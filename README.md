## How to play 🟠 👾

At launch you will be asked to choose between the CLI and the GUI versions. 
Right after that you will have to insert your username, the server IP (127.0.0.1), server port (1234), and decide whether to *create* a new match or *join* an existing one. 

- **Create**: in the *create settings* you will need to insert one *game ID*, the *game mode* (*easy/expert*) and the *number of players* that will join the game (*up to 3*)
- **Join**: in the *join settings* you will only need to insert the desired *game ID* and the game will send you to the match lobby, waiting for the match to reach the set number of active players.
